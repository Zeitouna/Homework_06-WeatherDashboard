# Homework_06-WeatherDashboard

## Description
This projects aims to understand the use of third-party API's and how to apply them - retrieving data from another application's API.

In this project the challenge is to build a **weather dashboard** that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. 

As for some people it can be annoying not to have all the weather information necessary on one page to plane a trip: this application will permit the user to see the weather outlook for multiple cities and thus plane trip with more ease.
